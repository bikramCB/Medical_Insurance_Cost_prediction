# Medical_Insurance_Cost_prediction
Self Project | Tool: Sklearn, Python

Objective: Helped medical insurance agency making a programmed framework that foresee clinical protection cost of a person.

• Executed exploratory data pre-processing & analysis to get a good comprehension of the given dataset.

• Divided dataset into train & test to hinder overfitting and exactly access the model.

• Fitted trained data into Linear Regression algorithm & evaluated the model by finding R Squared value of train, test.

• Constructed a predictive framework to sort out exact insurance cost by putting input data.
