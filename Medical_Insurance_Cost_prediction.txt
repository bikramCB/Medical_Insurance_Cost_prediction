 1. first we collect insurance data.
2. then we perform data analysis just to understand what is the data is actually about and find the relationship
   among the graphs and other curves.
3. after getting data we dont directly put it into ML model, we have to do data preprocessing.
4. before getting into ML model we split the datas into test and train data.
5. train Linear Regression model
6. then bring new data to trained Linear regressin model to predict the insurance cost.
